Description:
This looks like a simple plugin that all you do is look at a chest and sell the stuff in it right? Wrong!
This has many more options than that. You can sell the chest your standing on, add a sign on a chest to auto sell it, or even all the chest in a selected region. You can control what price each item goes for, the extra money an enchantment adds, and even blacklist items and enchantments from being sold.
